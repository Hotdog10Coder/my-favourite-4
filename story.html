“ Ahhh ” everyone shouted “How did we get here” panicked Rex, their pod was catching fire “321 Brace for impact!” cried K-30S. 

 

Splash!!! They fell in the water with a big SLAP. Their pod was sinking and everyone was banging the doors of the pod to get out, but it was no use, they were going to have to wait. After sometime some creatures came and some looked confused and the others looked petrified “they are back” koi cried “who” inquired the shark “humans” replied the hammerhead shark. Then Rex woke up and saw all the creatures staring at him “What happened” said Rex NOT realising we was underwater on planet earth “what happened?” said Jolene “can't you see we are underwater on a different planet, are you menta-” “Be quiet” said Rex fascinated as he looked at the animals, then Jolene also looked at them. She was in awe; these were the creatures that she had read from her books back home. 

“Oh My!” said K-30S “What a place, really is lovely” he continued “Lovely? with the possibility of drowning, you have a loose circuit!” said Rex 

“There is no need to be rude” K-30S replied as Jolene screamed in terror “What is that!” she said shaking “Some sort of Whale” cried Rex trying to get out of the capsule “WHY ARE THEY HERE!” said the Whale “THEY DESTROYED US!” Shouted the Whale. “Their race was the enemy but these individuals are not” replied the Eel “We bring no harm” cried Rex “We know,” said the Hammerhead “We will get you out of here” said the Whale pushing the capsule out of the water “Now let's go back home!” Said Rex ”321 commencing teleportation” said K-30S.
